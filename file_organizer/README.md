### File Organizer using Pathlib in Python

This Python script utilizes pathlib to efficiently organize files within a specified directory based on their file extensions. It defines a dictionary of file extensions mapped to corresponding directories and then moves files accordingly. The script also creates an 'OTHER' directory for files with unrecognized extensions and removes empty directories."

This description is concise, informative, and highlights the key functionalities of the script. You can further enhance it by:

 * Adding a specific use case: For example, "This script is designed to organize files downloaded from various sources."
 * Mentioning any specific features: For example, "Supports a wide range of file extensions and provides flexibility for customization."
 
I hope this helps!
