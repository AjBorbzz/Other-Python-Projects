## *Security Automation Code Dump*

### **Overview**

This repository serves as my **personal knowledge base and code dump** for all things related to **Security Automation**. It contains a collection of scripts, snippets, and experimental projects that I’ve written or researched to automate repetitive tasks, process security data, and improve incident response efficiency.

The goal is to **centralize reusable code** that bridges the gap between cybersecurity operations and modern software engineering — combining **Python**, **data engineering**, and **automation frameworks** like **Cortex XSOAR**, **XSIAM**, and **cloud-native security tools**.

### **What You’ll Find Here**

*  **Python Utilities** – small, modular scripts for data parsing, enrichment, and reporting
*  **Automation Functions** – helpers for SOAR playbooks, API integrations, and dynamic field mapping
*  **Data Processing Pipelines** – log normalization, IOC enrichment, and threat intelligence feeds
*  **Security Operations Tools** – automated ticket handling, incident correlation, and playbook logic prototypes
*  **Integrations & Connectors** – API wrappers and templates for services like VirusTotal, URLScan, and O365
*  **AI & LLM Experiments** – prototypes leveraging local or cloud-based LLMs for security use cases (triage summaries, phishing detection, etc.)

---

### **Purpose**

This repo is meant to be a **living collection** — a technical notebook that grows with my journey as a **Security Automation Engineer**.
Whether it’s a quick prototype, a function refactor, or a fully working automation, the intent is to:

* Preserve useful code for reuse in future SOAR or cloud automation projects
* Encourage modular and readable Python coding in the security engineering domain
* Serve as a reference for others exploring **Python-powered security automation**

### **Disclaimer**

These scripts are for **educational and research purposes** only.
Before using any code in production environments, review and tailor it to your organization’s security policies and infrastructure requirements.
