In cybersecurity platforms (SIEM, SOAR, scanners), you often have multiple detection engines:

* Port scanning

* Vulnerability scanning

* Malware signature scanning

* Configuration compliance checks

All scanners:

* Accept a target

* Perform a scan

* Return structured findings

* Emit metadata (severity, tool name, timestamp)

But each scanner works differently internally.
