# Top 10 Use Cases for Multiprocessing in Python

Multiprocessing in Python is a powerful tool that allows you to execute tasks concurrently, improving the performance
for CPU-based tasks. 

We will be covering the top 10 use cases for multiprocessing in Python. 

1. Parallel Data Processing for Large Datasets.
    * Parsing and analyzing multiple csv files at once.
2. Parallel Web scraping.
    * Scraping product details from multiple e-commerce websites concurrently.
3. Simulating Parallel Systems (Monte Carlo Simulations).
    * Simulating stock price movements or weather patterns.
4. Machine Model Training.
    * Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation with multiple models trained in parallel.
5. Image processing and computer vision.
    * Applying a filter to multiple images or video frames simultaneously for real-time analysis.
6. Parallelize Search Algorithms
    * Searching through a large collection of data (example: databases or files) for specific patterns or values can be split into smaller tasks that run simultaneously.
    * Searching through millions of log entries for specific events or errors.

7. Scientific Computing & Numerical Simulations:
    * Solving large-scale physics simulations, such as fluid dynamics or structural analysis.

8. Parallelizing I/O Bound Operations.
    * Reading data from multiple files and writing results to separate files concurrently.

9. Video or Audio Encoding / Decoding.
    * Converting a set of video files into different formats concurrently.

10. Parallel Text Processing and Natural Language Processing.
    * Preprocessing a large collection of documents for sentinel analysis for training NLP models.
