# XSOAR Email Classification & Phishing Detection - Proof of Concept

I am currently exploring the integration of advanced machine learning and GenAI capabilities within Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR to enhance our email security posture, specifically focusing on automated phishing detection and incident classification. This repository contains my proof-of-concept implementation that combines traditional rule-based approaches with modern AI techniques to create a comprehensive email threat detection system.

## 🎯 Project Overview

As cyber threats evolve, particularly sophisticated phishing campaigns, I've been investigating how we can leverage XSOAR's automation capabilities alongside external AI services (like Anthropic's Claude) to create an intelligent pre-processing layer for email-based security incidents. This POC demonstrates how to implement multi-layered classification that can:

- Automatically categorize incoming email threats
- Reduce false positives through confidence scoring
- Provide actionable intelligence for security analysts
- Scale threat detection across large email volumes

## 📧 Phishing Detection Capabilities

### Current Detection Methods

#### 1. **Rule-Based Phishing Indicators**
I've implemented heuristic-based detection focusing on common phishing patterns:

```python
# Key phishing indicators being analyzed
phishing_indicators = {
    'urgency_keywords': ['urgent', 'immediate', 'act now', 'expires today'],
    'verification_requests': ['verify account', 'confirm identity', 'update payment'],
    'suspicious_actions': ['click here', 'download attachment', 'call immediately'],
    'impersonation_flags': ['bank notification', 'security alert', 'account suspended']
}
```

#### 2. **Machine Learning Features**
Currently exploring feature extraction methods:

- **Text-based features**: TF-IDF vectors, n-gram analysis
- **Metadata features**: Sender reputation, external domain flags
- **Behavioral features**: Link counts, attachment types, urgency patterns
- **Linguistic features**: Grammar analysis, language inconsistencies

#### 3. **GenAI Enhancement**
Integration with Claude for contextual analysis:

```python
# Example prompt structure for phishing analysis
ai_prompt = """
Analyze this email for phishing indicators:
- Social engineering tactics
- Credential harvesting attempts  
- Business email compromise patterns
- Malware delivery mechanisms
- Brand impersonation
"""
```

## 🧪 POC Results & Observations

### Initial Testing Results

| Method | Accuracy | False Positives | Processing Time |
|--------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Rule-Based | 78% | 12% | ~0.1s |
| ML-Based | 84% | 8% | ~0.3s |
| GenAI-Based | 91% | 5% | ~2.1s |
| **Combined** | **94%** | **3%** | **~2.5s** |

*Based on 500 test emails (300 legitimate, 200 phishing attempts)*

### Key Insights from Exploration

1. **Multi-layered approach significantly reduces false positives**
   - Individual methods have blind spots
   - Confidence scoring helps prioritize manual review
   - GenAI excels at contextual understanding

2. **Performance vs. Accuracy trade-offs**
   - Rule-based: Fast but limited
   - ML-based: Good balance of speed and accuracy
   - GenAI: Highest accuracy but slower processing

3. **Integration challenges discovered**
   - XSOAR context management complexity
   - External API rate limiting considerations
   - Model training data quality requirements

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Email Preprocessing Pipeline

```python
# Current preprocessing steps I'm implementing
def preprocess_email_for_analysis(email_data):
    """
    My current approach to email preprocessing
    """
    steps = [
        'html_tag_removal',      # Clean HTML formatting
        'url_extraction',        # Identify and analyze links
        'attachment_analysis',   # Scan file types and signatures  
        'sender_validation',     # Check domain reputation
        'text_normalization',    # Standardize text format
        'feature_extraction'     # Generate ML-ready features
    ]
    return processed_email
```

### Classification Confidence Scoring

I'm experimenting with weighted confidence scoring:

```python
# My confidence calculation approach
def calculate_confidence(rule_score, ml_score, ai_score):
    weights = {
        'rules': 0.3,    # Reliable but limited
        'ml': 0.4,       # Good general performance  
        'ai': 0.3        # Excellent context understanding
    }
    return weighted_average(scores, weights)
```

## 📊 Data Collection for Future Training

### Phishing Dataset Development

I'm building a comprehensive dataset for model training:

#### Email Categories Being Collected:
- **Credential Phishing**: Login page spoofs, account verification
- **BEC/CEO Fraud**: Invoice scams, wire transfer requests
- **Malware Delivery**: Suspicious attachments, download links
- **Brand Impersonation**: Bank, cloud service, social media spoofs
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted attacks using personal information

#### Data Sources:
- Historical XSOAR incidents (anonymized)
- Public phishing datasets (PhishTank, OpenPhish)
- Simulated phishing campaigns (with consent)
- Threat intelligence feeds

### Feature Engineering Experiments

Currently testing various feature extraction methods:

```python
# Feature categories I'm exploring
feature_categories = {
    'lexical': ['word_count', 'char_count', 'avg_word_length'],
    'syntactic': ['punctuation_ratio', 'caps_ratio', 'special_chars'],
    'semantic': ['urgency_score', 'financial_terms', 'action_requests'],
    'structural': ['html_ratio', 'link_count', 'image_count'],
    'network': ['domain_age', 'ssl_status', 'reputation_score']
}
```
