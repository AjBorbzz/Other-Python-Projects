|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                      | Content Delivery Network (CDN) for delivering static and dynamic content with low latency | Global traffic distribution and application acceleration, improving performance for global users |
| **Primary Use Case**             | Caching and delivering web content (e.g., images, videos, static files) with low latency | Optimizing global application performance for both static and dynamic traffic, regardless of the user's location |
| **Global Reach**                 | Uses a network of edge locations around the world to cache and deliver content | Uses a global network of AWS edge locations to route traffic to optimal endpoints based on health and proximity |
| **Target Audience**              | Primarily content delivery for websites, media, or mobile apps | Primarily used for applications with global users needing high availability and low latency |
| **Content Caching**              | Yes, caches content at edge locations for improved performance and reduced load on origin servers | No caching; focuses on routing traffic to the most optimal endpoints (e.g., EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers) |
| **Routing & Traffic Distribution**| Routes user requests to the nearest edge location based on the user's geographic location | Routes user traffic to the closest healthy endpoint using static IP addresses, based on performance and health checks |
| **Protocols Supported**          | HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, HTTP/2, and more          | TCP, UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets                  |
| **Endpoint Types**               | Origin servers (e.g., S3, EC2, custom origins)    | EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and ALB targets |
| **Latency Optimization**         | Reduces latency by caching content closer to end users | Improves application performance by routing traffic through the optimal AWS region or endpoint |
| **Global Failover**              | Provides failover capabilities by routing to the next nearest edge location if an edge location fails | Provides automatic traffic failover to healthy endpoints in different regions to ensure availability and uptime |
| **Health Checks**                | Does not provide built-in health checks for origin servers, but can integrate with Lambda for custom behaviors | Yes, includes health checks for endpoints to ensure traffic is routed only to healthy resources |
| **Integration with Other AWS Services** | Tight integration with S3, EC2, Lambda@Edge, API Gateway, Elastic Load Balancers, and more | Tight integration with EC2, ALB, NLB, Elastic IPs, and can improve performance for multiple types of applications |
| **Security Features**            | Supports SSL/TLS encryption, AWS WAF, geo-restriction, IAM roles, and Lambda@Edge for custom logic | Supports AWS Shield for DDoS protection, integrates with AWS WAF, and allows endpoint-level health checks |
| **Performance Features**         | Caches content at edge locations to reduce load times and server resource utilization | Routes traffic through a global network of optimally chosen endpoints to reduce latency and improve throughput |
| **Ease of Use**                  | Easy to configure for caching static or dynamic content; more complex when configuring advanced behaviors with Lambda@Edge | Easy to configure, requires setting up endpoints and defining traffic routing policies but abstracts complexity of global traffic routing |
| **Pricing Model**                | Pay-as-you-go based on data transfer, requests, and data served from edge locations | Pay-as-you-go based on number of accelerators, data processed, and traffic forwarded to endpoints |
| **Typical Use Cases**            | - Streaming media<br>- Static website hosting<br>- Software distribution<br>- Dynamic content delivery | - Real-time applications (gaming, IoT)<br>- Global API endpoints<br>- Multi-region web applications<br>- Disaster recovery and high availability applications |

### Key Differences:

1. **Core Functionality:**
   - **CloudFront** is a CDN service that caches and delivers content (static or dynamic) to end users from edge locations globally. It's primarily used for improving the speed of web content delivery.
   - **Global Accelerator** is focused on optimizing the global performance and availability of applications, improving the routing of traffic to the best available endpoints in multiple regions.

2. **Traffic Caching vs. Routing:**
   - **CloudFront** caches static content at the edge locations, reducing the load on origin servers and speeding up content delivery to end users.
   - **Global Accelerator** does not cache content but routes traffic to the best-performing AWS endpoint based on health and proximity.

3. **Health Checks and Failover:**
   - **CloudFront** does not provide direct health checks for origin servers, although you can use Lambda@Edge for custom logic.
   - **Global Accelerator** includes health checks for endpoints and will reroute traffic to healthy resources in the case of endpoint failure.

4. **Protocols Supported:**
   - **CloudFront** is primarily HTTP/HTTPS-focused and optimizes delivery of web content.
   - **Global Accelerator** supports multiple protocols, including TCP, UDP, and HTTP/HTTPS, making it more suitable for a broader range of applications.

5. **Typical Use Cases:**
   - **CloudFront** is best for content-heavy applications, such as media streaming, static websites, software distribution, and e-commerce sites.
   - **Global Accelerator** is ideal for applications that require low-latency global performance, such as real-time applications, APIs, multi-region applications, and disaster recovery solutions.

### When to Use Each:

- **Use CloudFront** when:
  - You need to deliver web content or media with low latency and high transfer speeds.
  - You want to cache static content to reduce load on your origin servers.
  - You need a CDN to support dynamic content or provide content delivery at the global edge.
  
- **Use Global Accelerator** when:
  - You need to improve the performance of global applications, especially those requiring low-latency or high availability.
  - You need to route traffic to multiple regions and endpoints automatically, ensuring users connect to the closest healthy resource.
  - Your application requires support for TCP or UDP traffic in addition to HTTP/HTTPS.

### Summary:
- **CloudFront** is optimized for content delivery and caching at the edge, making it the ideal choice for static and dynamic web content, media, and file delivery.
- **Global Accelerator** is more suited for applications that need global traffic routing, high availability, and performance optimization, especially for real-time and interactive workloads.
