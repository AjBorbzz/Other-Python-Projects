# **One Deal A Day Sale Architecture on AWS**

An e-commerce company is planning to launch a *One-Deal-A-Day* website on AWS. The website will feature a single product on sale for 24 hours, requiring the infrastructure to handle massive traffic spikes—millions of requests per hour—with millisecond latency during peak times. The goal is to achieve this scalability while maintaining **minimal operational overhead** and leveraging AWS-managed services.

### **Solution Architecture Overview**

This architecture uses fully managed AWS services to deliver high performance, scalability, and reliability with reduced operational complexity. Below is a breakdown of the components and their roles:

---

### **1. Frontend: Static Website Hosting**
- **Service:** Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- **Details:**
  - Host all static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images) in an Amazon S3 bucket.
  - Use the static website hosting feature for low-cost and highly reliable delivery.
  - S3 provides virtually unlimited storage and scales automatically to handle high request rates.

---

### **2. Content Delivery: Accelerate Global Access**
- **Service:** Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
- **Details:**
  - Deploy a CloudFront distribution to cache and serve static content at edge locations closest to users, reducing latency.
  - Set the S3 bucket as the **origin** for the CloudFront distribution.
  - Use CloudFront's **Lambda@Edge** to handle minor customizations, such as URL rewrites or request headers.

---

### **3. Backend: API Layer**
- **Services:** AWS API Gateway + AWS Lambda
- **Details:**
  - Implement a **serverless architecture** for backend logic using **AWS Lambda** functions.
  - Use **Amazon API Gateway** to expose RESTful APIs that interact with the Lambda functions.
  - APIs handle operations like retrieving deal details, tracking sales, and processing user interactions.
  - This approach scales seamlessly to handle millions of requests per hour while incurring costs only for the resources consumed.

---

### **4. Data Storage: High-Performance NoSQL Database**
- **Service:** Amazon DynamoDB
- **Details:**
  - Store product information, user activity, and sales data in **Amazon DynamoDB**.
  - DynamoDB provides:
    - **High throughput and low latency** at scale, perfect for handling millions of read/write requests.
    - **On-demand scaling** to adapt to fluctuating traffic without manual intervention.
  - Enable **DynamoDB Streams** to capture changes in real time for analytics or downstream processing.

---

### **5. Security and Monitoring**
- **Security:**
  - Use **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) with CloudFront to protect against common web threats like SQL injection and DDoS attacks.
  - Secure S3 content using **Bucket Policies** and **IAM roles**.
  - Enforce HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates managed by **AWS Certificate Manager** (ACM) for CloudFront.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor application performance, including Lambda invocation metrics and API Gateway request logs.
  - Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** for automated alerts during unusual traffic patterns or errors.

---

### **Benefits of This Architecture**
1. **Scalability:** Fully serverless architecture scales automatically to handle millions of requests per hour.
2. **Low Latency:** CloudFront edge caching ensures fast delivery of static assets, while API Gateway and DynamoDB provide near-instant responses.
3. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay-as-you-go pricing model minimizes costs by only charging for actual usage.
4. **High Availability:** Managed services like S3, DynamoDB, and CloudFront provide built-in fault tolerance and availability.

---

### **Additional Considerations**
- **Scaling Backend Services:** Use **AWS Step Functions** for complex workflows or if future features require chaining multiple Lambda functions.
- **Global User Base:** Use **Amazon Route 53** for latency-based DNS routing to direct users to the nearest CloudFront edge location.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Leverage **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** to analyze user interactions and generate insights on daily deals.
