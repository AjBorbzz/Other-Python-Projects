The correct answer is:  

## Use Cost Explorer's granular filtering feature to perform an in-depth analysis of EC2 costs based on instance types.


This solution provides the **LEAST operational overhead** while addressing the requirements:  
1. **AWS Cost Explorer** offers built-in, intuitive tools to analyze costs.  
2. Using **granular filtering** allows the solutions architect to break down costs by **service, instance type, region**, and other dimensions.  
3. The feature provides historical data, including the last 2 months, and visualizes it through graphs, making it easy to compare costs and identify trends or anomalies.  

### Why not the other options?  
- **A. AWS Budgets:**  
  - AWS Budgets is useful for tracking and notifying users about cost or usage thresholds but lacks detailed historical analysis and graphical capabilities.  
- **C. AWS Billing and Cost Management Dashboard:**  
  - While the dashboard provides basic graphs, it is less granular and lacks the filtering capabilities necessary to analyze specific instance types effectively.  
- **D. AWS Cost and Usage Reports with QuickSight:**  
  - This approach involves significantly more operational overhead as it requires setting up reports, storing them in Amazon S3, and configuring Amazon QuickSight for visualization. While powerful, it is overkill for this use case.  

### Conclusion:  
**AWS Cost Explorer** is the most efficient and cost-effective tool for this scenario, fulfilling the requirement with minimal effort.
